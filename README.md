# CrashProofer
WoW Utility Mod

TL;DR - Enables backup of arbitrary table data to guild members.

Ordinarily, addon data in memory is saved on a non-error logout.  If you crash, addon data in active memory is lost.  CrashProofer backs up your data to your guild members so they can send it back to you if your game client fails to shut down properly.
